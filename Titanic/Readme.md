# Machine learning and neural network based model for predicting survival in titanic

## Contains python scripts used in this competition [Titanic: machine learning from disaster] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

There are two different approaches used to predict the survival on Titanic. 

## Random Forests/ SVM

Use titanic.py to test SVM or Random forests on titanic dataset.

## Neural Network

Use titanic_neural_network.py to test a simple neural network with two hidden layers.
